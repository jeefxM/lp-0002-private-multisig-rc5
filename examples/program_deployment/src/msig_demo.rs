//! Shared LP-0002 multisig DEMO fixture — the single source of truth for every runner.
//!
//! All five `run_*` bins read their inputs from here so that `enroll`, `create_proposal`,
//! `approve`, and `execute` compose into ONE valid on-chain chain:
//!   * `enroll` publishes the 3 demo member leaves → registry `member_root` == [`member_root`].
//!   * `create_proposal` freezes that same [`member_root`] into the `ProposalState`.
//!   * `approve` proves membership of [`approver_secret`] against that root via a depth-5
//!     [`approver_path`] (NOT a bare 2-leaf path), incrementing the count.
//!   * `execute` releases the treasury once `approval_count >= THRESHOLD`.
//!
//! MEMBERSHIP-BY-DERIVATION (LP-0002 "members hold shielded accounts"): each member secret is a
//! GENUINE shielded-account nullifier secret key (`nsk`) HD-derived from a key tree, NOT an
//! arbitrary constant. [`member_secrets`] walks the SAME derivation a real wallet uses
//! (`SeedHolder` -> `SecretSpendingKey` -> `produce_private_key_holder(Some(index)).nullifier_secret_key`),
//! at HD indices 0/1/2 of one demo seed. Control of `nsk` == control of the shielded account at
//! that index (the `nsk` is exactly what authorizes spends from that account), so enrolling
//! `member_leaf(nsk)` binds membership to a real shielded account by DERIVATION. The leaf stays a
//! one-way hash of the PRIVATE `nsk` (`H(LEAF_DOMAIN || nsk)`), so the public registry leaf does
//! NOT publish the account's `npk`/`AccountId` and an observer cannot link the leaf to any
//! on-chain account. This is derivation-binding, NOT an in-circuit live-account / commitment-tree
//! membership proof. See docs/LP-0002-solution.md "Approach" for the honest scope.
//!
//! The `ProposalState` account is a fixed demo-keypair-derived account (see [`proposal_account_id`]):
//! `create_proposal` CLAIMS it (signed by [`proposal_keypair`]); `approve` and `execute` merely
//! REFERENCE it by the same `AccountId`. The treasury/recipient/registry stay msig public PDAs.
//!
//! The demo seed/keys here are obvious throwaway DEMO values. Do NOT reuse in production.
//!
//! The in-process compose test (`msig_full_flow_composes`, lee/state_machine/src/state.rs) exercises the same
//! Merkle scheme with its own local member secrets (it cannot import this crate:
//! `program_deployment` depends on `lee`, not the reverse); it is self-contained and root-internal.
