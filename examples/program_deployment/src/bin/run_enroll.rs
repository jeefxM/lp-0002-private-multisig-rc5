//! TASK C runner 2 — PUBLIC tx(s): enroll the demo member leaves into the msig MembersRegistry.
//!
//! `MsigInstruction::Enroll { leaf }` appends `leaf = member_leaf(secret)` to the registry account
//! and recomputes `member_root`. Enroll is one-leaf-per-tx, so this runner builds and submits ONE
//! enroll tx per demo member (see [`msig_demo::member_leaves`]). After all three land, the
//! registry's `member_root` equals [`msig_demo::member_root`] — the exact root that
//! `create_proposal` freezes and `approve` proves membership against.
//!
//! BUG-1 FIX: the registry is a SIGNER-OWNED account (the demo registry keypair), NOT a PDA. Each
//! enroll is signed by [`msig_demo::registry_keypair`] so the guest's `Claim::Authorized` of the
//! registry passes apply (the registry is a signer). The guest does not require the registry at any
//! specific PDA address. Nonces advance 0,1,2 as each enroll lands (the registry's first claim and
//! every subsequent signed enroll bumps its public-account nonce); submit them in order.
//!
//! NOTE: ON-CHAIN when run. Build-only is safe. To fire it:
//!   LEE_WALLET_HOME_DIR=/root/lez-v012/wallet-home-lp0002 \
//!     cargo run --release -p program_deployment --bin run_enroll
