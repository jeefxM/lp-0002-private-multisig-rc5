//! TASK C runner 5 — PRIVACY tx: anonymous M-of-N approval (the hard one).
//!
//! A privacy-preserving transaction mutates a PUBLIC ProposalState (mask 0) while the member secret
//! + Merkle path + proposal_id travel as a PRIVATE instruction witness. The guest verifies in-guest
//! Merkle membership against the snapshotted member_root, derives a proposal-bound vote nullifier,
//! rejects double-votes, and increments the count. The voter rides a PRIVATE shielded account (the
//! member's LIVE voting account, identifier [`msig_demo::VOTE_IDENTIFIER`]) that emits the
//! commitment/nullifier the privacy tx requires. The voter stays anonymous.
//!
//! rc5 PORT: this drops the v0.1.2 manual path (fresh throwaway rider keys, `get_account`,
//! hand-built `AccountWithMetadata`, `execute_and_prove`, `Message`/`WitnessSet`, raw
//! `send_transaction`) for the rc5 WALLET-MANAGED API:
//! [`WalletCore::send_privacy_preserving_tx`]. The wallet derives the pre_states (incl. the live
//! private rider via its membership proof), builds the message, proves, and submits. Membership
//! inputs still come from the shared [`msig_demo`] fixture so `enroll`/`create_proposal`/`approve`
//! compose into one valid chain.
//!
//! REVIEW ITEM #6 (in-circuit live-account binding): the rider is presented as the member's LIVE
//! shielded voting account at [`msig_demo::VOTE_IDENTIFIER`], keyed by the SAME membership `secret`
//! (`nsk`). The guest asserts `rider.account_id == for_regular_private_account(npk(secret),
//! VOTE_IDENTIFIER)` AND `rider.account != Account::default()`, so the anonymous vote is bound to
//! the member's LIVE shielded account — not a fabricated fresh rider. The pre-check below fails fast
//! (before the prove) if that voting account is not live/tracked on this wallet.
//!
//! rc5-LOCAL RIDER VARIANT: the rider is `AccountIdentity::PrivateOwned(voting_id)`, NOT
//! `PrivateShared`. For the LOCAL demo the member's voting KeyChain is imported into THIS wallet's
//! key tree (`run_setup_voters`) and funded+tracked by a shielded transfer to `Private/<voting_id>`.
//! `PrivateOwned` is the ONLY rider variant whose pre_state the wallet can correctly supply for a
//! demo-keyed account: `private_key_tree_acc_preparation` reads the live state + membership proof
//! from the imported key tree (whereas `PrivateShared`'s pre_state comes from a shared-account map
//! with no public injection path). The circuit still builds the SAME
//! `PrivateAuthorizedUpdate{nsk, membership_proof}` arm review item #6 binds the vote to, so the
//! in-circuit semantics are unchanged.
//!
//! NOTE: ON-CHAIN when run. Build-only is safe. To fire it (LOCAL rc5):
//!   APPROVER_INDEX=0 LEE_WALLET_HOME_DIR=<home> RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 \
//!     cargo run --release -p program_deployment --bin run_approve
