//! TASK C runner — PUBLIC tx(s): bootstrap the treasury (and recipient) PDAs on-chain.
//!
//! BUG-2 FIX. A plain `authenticated_transfer` to the uninitialized treasury PDA is rejected:
//! authenticated_transfer would `Claim::Authorized` the fresh (default-owned) recipient, and apply
//! only accepts that claim for a SIGNER or a caller-authorized PDA — a PDA address holds no key and
//! can never sign, so a top-level transfer can never bootstrap it (proven in-process by
//! `msig_fund_treasury_pda_rejected`, which reproduces the exact `ClaimedUnauthorizedAccount`).
//!
//! `MsigInstruction::InitTreasury { seed, transfer_program_id }` fixes this: msig chains to
//! authenticated_transfer's amount-0 initialize with `pda_seeds = [seed]`, so the callee claims the
//! treasury PDA under msig's PDA authorization. The treasury ends up authenticated_transfer-owned
//! with balance 0. A SUBSEQUENT plain transfer (no claim — the PDA is now non-default-owned) funds
//! it, and `Execute` later drains it. We init BOTH the treasury PDA and the recipient PDA (the
//! execute credit needs the recipient owned by authenticated_transfer too).
//!
//! Full on-chain bootstrap order:
//!   1. run_init_treasury           (this runner: InitTreasury treasury + recipient)
//!   2. wallet auth-transfer send --from <payer> --to Public/<treasury> --amount <N>   (fund it)
//!   3. run_execute                 (drains treasury → recipient at threshold)
//!
//! NOTE: ON-CHAIN when run. Build-only is safe. To fire it:
//!   LEE_WALLET_HOME_DIR=/root/lez-v012/wallet-home-lp0002 \
//!     cargo run --release -p program_deployment --bin run_init_treasury
