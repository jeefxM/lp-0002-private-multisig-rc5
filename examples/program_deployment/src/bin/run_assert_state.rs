//! LP-0002 read-only post-flow assertion (no network mutation).
//!
//! Reads the live on-chain state from the sequencer the wallet config points at and asserts the
//! demo outcome. Used by `scripts/lp0002-demo-rc5.sh` as the load-bearing green/red gate. It mutates
//! nothing (only `get_account`), so it is safe to run repeatedly.
//!
//! Assertions (all derived from the shared `msig_demo` fixture so they track the real demo):
//!   * proposal `approval_count` (data[64..68] LE u32) == `EXPECT_COUNT`   (default THRESHOLD=2)
//!   * treasury PDA balance                          == `EXPECT_TREASURY`  (default 0 after drain)
//!   * recipient PDA balance                         == `EXPECT_RECIPIENT` (default = funded amount)
//!
//! Overridable via env (all decimal): EXPECT_COUNT, EXPECT_TREASURY, EXPECT_RECIPIENT.
//! Exits non-zero on the first failed assertion so the shell script fails loudly.
//!
