//! TASK C runner 5b — PRIVACY tx: anonymous M-of-N approval, SECRET-DRIVEN (anti-#87).
//!
//! Identical proof/tx machinery to `run_approve`, with ONE load-bearing difference: the member
//! identity is NOT read from the compile-time `msig_demo` fixture (`approver_index()` /
//! `approver_secret()`). It is derived ENTIRELY from the runtime env var `APPROVER_SECRET_HEX`:
//!
//!   * `secret`      = hex-decoded `APPROVER_SECRET_HEX` (32 bytes).
//!   * `target_leaf` = `msig_core::member_leaf(&secret)`.
//!   * `idx`         = position of `target_leaf` in `msig_demo::member_leaves()`; if absent we
//!                     print "not an enrolled member" and exit NON-ZERO WITHOUT proving.
//!   * `merkle_path` = `msig_core::merkle_path(&member_leaves(), idx)` against `member_root()`.
//!   * `vpk`         = `msig_demo::member_vpks()[idx]` — the SAME member's post-quantum ML-KEM
//!                     viewing key (the rider account's keys are bound to the resolved member).
//!   * the SAME `secret` is placed in `MsigInstruction::Approve { secret, .. }`.
//!
//! So the user's entered secret simultaneously (a) selects the Merkle leaf/path the guest checks
//! membership against, (b) is the witness the guest hashes into the proposal-bound vote nullifier,
//! AND (c) keys the PRIVATE voting account (`PrivateShared` rider, identifier
//! [`msig_demo::VOTE_IDENTIFIER`]) that review item #6 binds the vote to. A wrong/absent secret is
//! rejected at the `.position()` gate (non-member) before any proof.
//!
//! rc5 PORT: drops the v0.1.2 manual rider/`execute_and_prove`/`Message`/`send_transaction` path
//! for the wallet-managed [`WalletCore::send_privacy_preserving_tx`] (see `run_approve`).
//!
