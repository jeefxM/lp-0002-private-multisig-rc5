# LP-0002 msig: PARTIAL-APPROVAL RESUME across a sequencer restart (review item #2),
# on a LOCAL Logos LEZ v0.2.0-rc5 standalone sequencer, asserted GREEN.
#
# RISC0_DEV_MODE=1, LOCAL ONLY — this script NEVER touches testnet.lez.logos.co and performs no
# real on-chain deploy. It is a sibling of scripts/lp0002-demo-rc5.sh and reuses the SAME setup,
# funding and runners; the only new thing it proves is durability of approval PROGRESS across a
# crash/restart of the sequencer.
#
# THE LOAD-BEARING CLAIM (review item #2):
#   A 2-of-3 proposal's approval state — member_root + approval_count + the per-member vote
#   nullifiers — lives in the unified ProposalState account on-chain, and the sequencer persists
#   that account state to RocksDB ATOMICALLY on every block (sequencer/core: produce_new_block ->
#   store.update(&block, .., &self.state) -> dbio.atomic_update). On startup, start_from_config does
#   `if rocksdb_path.exists() { open_db; get_lee_state() } else { create_db_with_genesis }`, so a
#   restart against the SAME data dir RESUMES the persisted state (no re-genesis, chain_height
#   continues from latest_block_meta). Therefore a partial approval (count==1) recorded before a
#   kill MUST still read 1 after the sequencer is killed and restarted on the same dir.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
#   boot seq (STABLE dir) -> setup voters -> deploy -> enroll x3 -> create_proposal -> fund voters
#   -> approve(member 0) [count 0->1] -> *** kill -9 the sequencer; restart it on the SAME dir ***
#   -> verify run_read_status STILL reports approval_count==1  <-- the load-bearing assertion
#   -> approve(member 1) [count 1->2] -> init_treasury -> fund treasury -> execute
#   -> run_assert_state GREEN.
#
# NOTE on durability timing: store.update() runs INSIDE produce_new_block, under the sequencer lock,
# atomically with the block. run_read_status reads the count over RPC only after that block exists,
# so "count==1 visible" already implies "count==1 persisted to RocksDB" — the kill -9 cannot race
# it. (The zone-sdk/Bedrock checkpoint that IS event-driven only covers bridge deposit/withdraw
# reconciliation, not account/approval state, which is replayed from get_lee_state on reopen.)
#
# What does NOT resume (documented honestly in docs/lp0002-reliability.md, REL-2): an in-flight
# LOCAL approve proof has no client-side checkpoint; if a member's prove is interrupted it re-runs
# from scratch. This script demonstrates the ON-CHAIN half (durable count), which is the property
# that makes re-running a member safe and lets a second member pick up from the persisted count.
