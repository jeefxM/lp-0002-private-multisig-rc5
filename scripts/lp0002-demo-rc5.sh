# LP-0002 msig 2-of-3 FULL flow on a LOCAL Logos LEZ v0.2.0-rc5 sequencer, asserted GREEN.
#
# RISC0_DEV_MODE=1, LOCAL ONLY — this script NEVER touches testnet.lez.logos.co and performs no
# real on-chain deploy. It boots a throwaway local sequencer, runs the whole multisig lifecycle,
# and exits non-zero unless run_assert_state passes (EXPECT_COUNT=2, treasury drained,
# recipient funded).
#
# Flow:
#   boot sequencer -> setup voters (import funder + members 0,1) -> deploy -> enroll x3
#   -> create_proposal -> shielded-fund member 0 & 1 voting accounts -> approve(0) -> approve(1)
#   -> init_treasury -> fund treasury -> execute -> run_assert_state GREEN.
#
# THE REVIEW-ITEM-#6 FUNDING SOLUTION (the crux):
#   run_approve pre-checks `wallet.check_private_account_initialized(voting_id)` and bails if the
#   member's voting account (`for_regular_private_account(npk(member_secret), VOTE_IDENTIFIER)`) is
#   not LIVE + tracked on the wallet. So before voting, members 0 and 1 each need a live, owned
#   private voting account at identifier 0:
#     * run_setup_voters imports each member's FULL HD-derived KeyChain (msig_demo::member_key_chain)
#       into the wallet key tree, and imports the genesis-funded public funder
#       (testnet_initial_state public account 0, balance 10000, directly spendable).
#     * a shielded transfer `auth-transfer send --from Public/<funder> --to Private/<voting_id>`
#       inits+funds the voting account AND makes the wallet decode/track its EXACT funded state
#       (matching the on-chain commitment) in-tx — no separate sync, no timing gap.
#   run_approve then rides the voting account as `AccountIdentity::PrivateOwned(voting_id)` (the only
#   rider variant whose pre_state the wallet can supply for a demo-keyed account); the circuit still
#   builds the same `PrivateAuthorizedUpdate{nsk, membership_proof}` arm the guest's #6 binds to.
#
# Read-after-mutate ordering is GATED (not slept): create_proposal-ready before approve(0);
# approval_count==1 before approve(1); approval_count==2 before execute; treasury owned-by-
# authenticated_transfer before funding it. Funding/treasury transfers block until landed.
